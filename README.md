# spottrack-iot-simulator

IoT simulator for the spottrack app. It pulls the device list from the backend,
generates parking signals and publishes them to an MQTT broker, exposing an HTTP
API plus a CLI to check how it is running and whether the signals were actually sent.

## Install

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```bash
python simulator/cli.py serve                     # or: python simulator/main.py
```

Configuration comes from flags or environment variables:

| Variable | Flag | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `MQTT_HOST` | `--mqtt-host` | `localhost` |
| `MQTT_PORT` | `--mqtt-port` | `1883` |
| `MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX` | `--topic-prefix` | `sensors` |
| `BACKEND_DEVICES_URL` | `--backend-url` | `http://localhost:8080/api/devices` |
| `SIMULATOR_PORT` | `--port` | `5000` |
| `EMIT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `--interval` | `8` |
| — | `--min-duration-min` / `--max-duration-min` | `5` / `20` |

The MQTT connection is made in the background: if the broker is down the simulator
still starts, keeps retrying and reconnects on its own. Signals published while
disconnected are counted as failed and shown as such by the CLI.

Signals are published to `sensors/<deviceId>/signal` as:

```json
{"deviceId": "SENSOR-001", "signalType": "ACTIVATED", "durationMs": 585000, "timestamp": "2026-09-02T05:19:41+00:00"}
```

## CLI

All commands except `serve` and `listen` talk to a running simulator over HTTP.
Point them somewhere else with `--url` or `SIMULATOR_URL` (e.g. the VM's address);
add `--json` to any of them for the raw response.

```bash
python simulator/cli.py health            # is it alive, is MQTT connected, is the loop running
python simulator/cli.py stats             # full picture: devices, loop, broker, sent/failed counters
python simulator/cli.py signals -n 20     # last signals: sent ok / FAIL, and whether the broker acked
python simulator/cli.py watch             # live dashboard (stats + last signals), refreshed every 2s
python simulator/cli.py status            # devices currently loaded
python simulator/cli.py update            # reload the device list from the backend
python simulator/cli.py devices A-1 A-2   # load device ids by hand, to test without the backend
python simulator/cli.py emit              # publish one signal right now
python simulator/cli.py emit --device-id A-1
python simulator/cli.py loop stop|start   # pause / resume the automatic emission
python simulator/cli.py listen            # subscribe to the broker and print the signals as they arrive
```

`signals` is the direct answer to "did the publisher really send anything":

```
WHEN       DEVICE                  DURATION  SENT   ACK    TOPIC
05:19:41   SENSOR-A                    585s  ok     ok     sensors/SENSOR-A/signal
05:19:39   SENSOR-A                    918s  FAIL   ...    sensors/SENSOR-A/signal
    error: The client is not currently connected.
```

* `SENT` — the client accepted the publish (broker reachable).
* `ACK` — paho confirmed the message left the client towards the broker.
* `listen` is the independent check: it connects to the broker as a subscriber, so
  whatever it prints really made it across the network.

## HTTP API

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | liveness, MQTT connection, loop state |
| GET | `/status` | devices currently loaded |
| GET | `/stats` | simulator + MQTT publisher counters |
| GET | `/signals?limit=N` | last published signals (max 50) |
| POST | `/update` | reload devices from the backend |
| PUT | `/devices` | `{"deviceIds": [...]}` — set devices manually |
| POST | `/emit` | `{"deviceId": "..."}` (optional) — publish one signal now |
| POST | `/loop` | `{"action": "start"\|"stop"}` |

## Running on the VM

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd spottrack-iot-simulator
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
MQTT_HOST=<broker-host> BACKEND_DEVICES_URL=<backend>/api/devices \
  .venv/bin/python simulator/cli.py serve
```

Then, from your machine, check it with:

```bash
python simulator/cli.py --url http://<vm-ip>:5000 watch
```

Open port 5000 only to whoever needs to monitor it — the API has no authentication,
and Flask's development server is not meant for production traffic.
